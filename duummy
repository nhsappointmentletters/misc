The search service can be used to deliver declaration information fast and puts the user in control. It negates the need for the overhead and administration of requesting individual reports and the skills/training overhead. Users will have the ability to search on key data attributes for a specific declaration and view the results (header and item level). The result sets will be ordered by relevance.

The Search tool will be available to the user via a front end web page and utilise Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to authenticate the user and protect sensitive data.
